To Do App | MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js 

• Engineered a task management application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js),
improving task organization with a responsive and modern interface.

• Utilized RESTful services to perform create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations, optimizing server
performance and ensuring efficient data handling with MongoDB queries.

• Improved user interaction by integrating React for real-time UI updates and using react-icons for a simple,
user-friendly design, simplifying the task creation process.
